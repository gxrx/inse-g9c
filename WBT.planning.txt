Drawing to a Java FX window - or canvas

Methods:
drawRectangle(x, y, width, height) // draw a rectangle
addText(Rectangle, ID, Name)  // add text to the rectangle - including Event id and name.
getNumUniqId(project) - returns the number of initial branches out WBT will need. (eg. [1.0, 1.1, 2.0] would return 2)
orderEvents() - orders the evens arrayList so we can draw rectangles one by one. (1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.1.1, 3.0 etc...)
1) add the project title in a box. Top Middle of window.


2) split the window into virtual columns being the number of unique first character ID.

3) draw events
-make sure events are ordered first.

for each unique ID
	for each event 
		see if the event is a sub tree.
			if yes, create new virtual column.
		draw a rect (column width x the unique ID) - (column width / 2), prevHeight)
		addTitletoBox(rectangle, event.getid, event.getname)
		addArrow(this-1 or TITLE, this)
		prevHeight =+ 30 (space things out)
		addTitleToBox(rectangle, event.getID, event.getName();
		addArrow(this-1 or TITLE, this)
	prevheight = 100
